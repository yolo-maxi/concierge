# 🪸 Concierge

**A deliberately _powerless_ landing-page agent.**
An embeddable chat widget + a sandboxed proxy that answers visitor questions using **only** a page's digested docs — fast, on-brand, and impossible to jailbreak into doing anything.

</div>

---

## Why it's safe by design

The whole thing rests on one decision: **the agent has no capabilities.** No tools, no browser, no retrieval, no function calling — pure text in / text out against a fixed knowledge base baked into the system prompt. That single choice does the heavy lifting:

| Property | How it's achieved |
|---|---|
| **Sandboxed** | The agent has no hands. Jailbreak it and the worst case is an off-brand sentence — there's nothing to escalate *to*. |
| **No hallucination** | The entire digested doc lives in the system prompt. It answers from what's in front of it and refuses when the answer isn't there. No vector DB, no retrieval step. |
| **Fast** | Small model (`deepseek-v4-flash` via Venice by default), streamed tokens, no retrieval round-trip. First token lands quick. |
| **Locked down** | A hardened prompt scopes it to one brand and refuses off-topic, injection, persona-swap, and prompt-extraction. The server also strips any client-supplied `system` role, caps message depth/length, and rate-limits per IP. |

It's less "build an AI agent" and more "great widget + a deliberately powerless chatbot."

## Architecture

```
your page  ──>  <Concierge/> widget        (holds no secrets, just an endpoint URL)
                      │  POST /chat
                      ▼
                concierge server           (the lockdown layer)
                      │  injects digested docs + hardened prompt,
                      │  strips client system role, rate-limits,
                      ▼  streams SSE, logs each turn to Telegram
                  Venice (OpenAI-compatible)
```

The widget **cannot** hold the model key — it only knows an endpoint URL. The server is the only thing that touches the key and the docs.

---

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
cp server/.env.example server/.env     # add your Venice key + a page brief
pnpm dev:server                        # proxy on :8787
pnpm --filter @concierge/widget build  # builds the React lib + the standalone embed
```

Then integrate one of two ways.

### A) Drop-in script — any site, no build step

The widget ships as a single self-mounting bundle. The server serves it at `/embed.js` (set `CONCIERGE_EMBED_FILE`), so a host page needs **one tag** and never hosts the asset itself:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="https://your-host/concierge/embed.js"
  data-endpoint="/concierge/chat"
  data-brand-name="Frontier"
  data-tagline="The order book, explained"
  data-greeting="Ask me anything about Frontier."
  data-suggestions="What is it?|How does copy liquidity work?|What does it cost?"
  data-launcher="pill"
  data-launcher-label="Ask Frontier"
  data-nudge="New here? Ask me anything — no docs-diving required."
  data-accent-color="#35d07a"
  data-accent-color2="#62e6a6"
  data-position="bottom-right"
></script>
```

### B) React component

```tsx
import { Concierge } from "@concierge/widget";

<Concierge
  endpoint="https://your-host/concierge/chat"
  brandName="Frontier"
  greeting="Ask me anything about Frontier."
  suggestions={["What is it?", "How does copy liquidity work?", "What does it cost?"]}
  launcher="pill"
  launcherLabel="Ask Frontier"
  nudge="New here? Ask me anything — no docs-diving required."
  accentColor="#35d07a"
  accentColor2="#62e6a6"
/>
```

Both render the same widget. State (transcript + open/closed) persists in `sessionStorage`, so the conversation **follows the visitor across same-origin page navigations**. Markdown `[label](url)` and bare URLs in answers render as links.

---

## Customization

Every prop has a `data-*` equivalent for the script embed (`launcherLabel` → `data-launcher-label`).

| Prop / `data-*` | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `endpoint` **(required)** | — | URL of the server's `/chat` endpoint |
| `brandName` | `Assistant` | Name shown in the header |
| `tagline` | `Ask me anything` | Subtitle under the brand name |
| `logoUrl` | spark icon | Header avatar image |
| `greeting` | generic | The assistant's opening line |
| `suggestions` | none | Starter chips (`\|`-separated in `data-suggestions`) |
| `placeholder` | `Ask a question…` | Input placeholder |
| `launcher` | `pill` | `pill` (labelled) or `bubble` (round) |
| `launcherLabel` | `Ask AI` | Text on the pill |
| `launcherIcon` | spark ✦ | Emoji to use instead of the spark icon |
| `nudge` | none | Proactive teaser bubble above the launcher |
| `nudgeDelay` | `5000` | Delay (ms) before the nudge appears |
| `online` | `true` | Show the live green dot on the avatar |
| `position` | `bottom-right` | `bottom-right` \| `bottom-left` \| `inline` |
| `defaultOpen` | `false` | Start expanded |
| `theme` | `midnight` | `midnight` (dark) or `light` |
| `accentColor` | `#6d8bff` | Primary accent (gradient, buttons, user bubbles) |
| `accentColor2` | tint of accent | Second gradient stop |
| `themeVars` | — | Override any `--cc-*` token directly (React) |
| `creditText` / `showCredit` | on | The small line under the input |

### Theming tokens

Anything not covered by a prop is a CSS variable on `.cc-root`. Override `--cc-bg`, `--cc-surface`, `--cc-text`, `--cc-radius`, `--cc-font`, etc. via `themeVars` or your own stylesheet. The accent **auto-generates a gradient and glow** from `--cc-accent`, so a single color already looks rich.

```tsx
<Concierge … themeVars={{ "--cc-radius": "12px", "--cc-font": "'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif" }} />
```

`window.Concierge.mount({...props})` is also exposed for manual mounting.

## The page brief (feeding it your agent)

A **brief** is the only thing that changes per page. It's the agent's entire world — and it doubles as the human docs source, so the two never drift:

```jsonc
{
  "brandName": "Frontier",
  "audience": "onchain traders who know what a CLOB is",
  "objective": "get them to open the live demo and place an order",
  "tone": "confident, technically precise, no marketing fluff",
  "cta": "Trade at the edge (clob.repo.box)",
  "docs": "Everything the agent is allowed to know, as plain digested text. Include a LINKS section with the exact URLs it may share — it can ONLY cite links that appear here, never invent one."
}
```

- **Single page:** point `CONCIERGE_BRIEF` at one brief JSON.
- **Multi page:** point `CONCIERGE_BRIEFS` at a `{ [pageId]: brief }` map; the widget selects with `pageId` / `data-page-id`.

**Tips for a good brief:** write `docs` as tight, factual prose (a few hundred words). State what the product *doesn't* do, so the agent refuses confidently. Add a `LINKS:` block of real URLs — the prompt lets it share links but only ones present verbatim in the brief.

---

## Conversation logging (optional, pluggable)

Each completed turn is normalized into one event and fanned out to every configured **sink**, fire-and-forget. Enable any combination; configure none and logging silently no-ops. The server keeps no transcript of its own — it stays stateless.

```jsonc
// the event every sink receives
{
  "type": "concierge.turn",
  "at": "2026-06-24T00:29:47.299Z",
  "brand": "Frontier",
  "pageId": "frontier",
  "pageUrl": "https://frontier.repo.box/",
  "sessionId": "s_ab12…",
  "emoji": "🛰️",            // stable per-session, handy for grouping
  "question": "is it custodial?",
  "answer": "No, Frontier is non-custodial. …",
  "ip": "203.0.113.7"
}
```

| Sink | Enable with | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Webhook** | `CONCIERGE_WEBHOOK_URL` (+ optional `CONCIERGE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) | `POST`s the event as JSON to your backend. The secret is sent as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`. The simplest, most flexible option — pipe it into your own DB/queue/analytics. |
| **Console** | `CONCIERGE_LOG_CONSOLE=1` | Writes one JSON line per turn to stdout — pipe it to a file, vector, journald, etc. |
| **Telegram** | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` (+ optional `TELEGRAM_THREAD_ID`) | Formatted message to a chat/forum topic, question in a blockquote, led by the page + session emoji. |

Adding your own sink is a few lines — drop a `(event) => Promise<void>` into the `SINKS` array in `server/src/log.ts`.

## Server env

See `server/.env.example`:

- `VENICE_API_KEY` / `VENICE_BASE_URL` / `VENICE_MODEL` — the model (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works)
- `CONCIERGE_BRIEF` or `CONCIERGE_BRIEFS` — the page brief(s)
- `CONCIERGE_EMBED_FILE` — path to `widget/dist/concierge-embed.js` to serve at `/embed.js`
- `TELEGRAM_*` — optional logging
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `RATE_LIMIT`, `PORT`

## Layout

```
concierge/
├─ widget/   # <Concierge/> React component + the standalone embed bundle
└─ server/   # the sandbox proxy (holds the key, injects docs + prompt, streams, logs)
